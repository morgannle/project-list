# A list of projects that I have done:

# 1. Pandemic simulation
An app to simulate behavior of a pandemic. This app used SEIR model to simulate behavior of a viral outbreak, you can modify various parameters to see their effects. Please note that this app is for educational purpose only and can not be used to model a real outbreak. You can access the app [here.](http://ec2-18-188-192-168.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:3838/simulation/)

Github: https://github.com/nghiale5991/pandemic_simulation

Tech used: Rshiny, R, Amazon AWS.

# 2. COVID 19 dashboard
This dashboard is to inform people of the pandemic situation in US as well as their state. Data is provided by CDC and The New York Times. You can access the dashboard with this [link](http://ec2-18-188-192-168.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:3838/myapp).

Tech used: Rshiny, R, Amazon AWS, Leaflet map.

# A list of custom functions that I have developed:

# 1. Feature selection using LASSO
 
The output of the function is a formula object that can be feed to glm or lm function. The first input is the dataframe, the second input is the name of the response variable, should be inside double quote, something like "response_variable".

Language: R
